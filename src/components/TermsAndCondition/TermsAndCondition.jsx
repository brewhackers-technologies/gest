            through an embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any
            news or content or information; but provides a brief summary of the
            content available in public domain within 60 (sixty) words or less
            by aggregating such content within one platform for easy access by
            You and for assisting You to find corresponding content of Your
            interest. The App does not host, display or transmit any content
            owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a
