To\n          ensure consistently high quality of content, we have developed strict\n          editorial guidelines, key features of which are highlighted below.\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            <p data-aos=\"fade-left\">Sourcing from multiple sources:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                We verify the facts stated in each gist from at least three\n                sources thereby ensuring their accuracy\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Our creators read several articles on each gist, distil the\n                common facts which emerge and then create original content for\n                the gist.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                This practice of sourcing from multiple article helps ensure\n                that our gists do not reflect the views from one news source and\n                are unbiased and un-opinionated.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li data-aos=\"fade-left\">\n            <p data-aos=\"fade-left\">Multiple layers of review:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                We make sure that every gist goes through multiple layers of\n                review. The first is a self-review process whereby the creator\n                of the gist reviews each gist based on a carefully designed\n                internal checklist which ensures that the gist meets the\n                language, grammar, plagiarism and content guidelines.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                At the second layer of review, a content editor again ensures\n                that each of the guidelines is met.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Along the way, we also use state-of-the-art anti-plagiarism\n                software which introduces another layer of review to ensure that\n                no improper content sneaks through.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                To constantly keep making our review process better, we, in May\n                2016, introduced an additional layer of review called SGF\n                (spelling, grammar and fact) check to ensure that all our gists\n                are error free to the extent possible.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li data-aos=\"fade-left\">\n            <p data-aos=\"fade-left\">We take plagiarism seriously:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                We believe in being creative instead of being copycats.\n                Plagiarism is simply not acceptable and any violation is not\n                tolerated.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                We strive to use only such content as is licenced to us by our\n                many content partners and in solely the manner agreed upon in\n                the terms of the licence granted by them.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                We apply high anti-plagiarism standards and flag use of even\n                three consecutive words from the source as potential plagiarism.\n                Of course, if these three consecutive words form part of a\n                direct quote, then we do not consider it to be plagiarism.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                We also use state of the art anti-plagiarism software which\n                applies similar high standards and flags any gist which does not\n                meet this standard.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                The multiple layers of review ensure that plagiarism is checked\n                at every stage.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li data-aos=\"fade-left\">\n            <p
